    <h2>Visitors</h2>
    <p>
        This page lists website visitors in order of their last page call.
    </p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p>
        Every user has a IP Address.
        Depending on the Internet Service Provider this IP changes from time to time. 
        As a result of this, it is possible that the same visitor is included in this list with several different IPs.
    </p>
    <h2>IP Lookup</h2>
    <p>
        Some web-services provide geo-tracking by the visitor IP.
        The tracking works on different ways and the results vary.
        Usually you will get a city close by the visitors real location.
