                <ul>
                    <li>In January 2006, we set up a trade for 3 shows. I sent him 3 shows, he received the shows and list them on his site. In return I've got NOTHING.</li>
                    <li>In July 2013 (more than 7 years after the rip-off), he contacted me again, apologizing for his bad deeds and offered me to work our old deal out.</li>
                    <li>So I picked again shows from his list. Next he told me he can't send me my wants because he has no longer access to his VHS collection. Later he posted this bad trader message about me on his site:  <?= CHtml::link('screenshot',Yii::app()->getTheme()->getBaseUrl() . '/images/badtrader_sam.jpg',array('style'=>'color:#000000')); ?></li>
                    <li>If he really want to work this out, I'm still open to do so, but I'm not interested in the wide-circualted DVDs, which he offered me the last time. I'm only interested in the VHS shows (like we set up the deal 2006).</li>
